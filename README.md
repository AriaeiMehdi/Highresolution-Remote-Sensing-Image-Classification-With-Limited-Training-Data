High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Classification With Limited Training Data

13th Iranian / 3rd International Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference (MVIP), 2024.

The proposed method leverages unsupervised feature learning with an asymmetric dual-input autoencoder followed by transfer learning on multi-spectral WorldView-3 satellite imagery. The pipeline extracts rich spatialâ€“spectral representations using autoencoders and then re-trains the encoder on limited labeled samples to achieve accurate per-pixel classification.
